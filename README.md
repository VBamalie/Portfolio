# Portfolio

## This is the web page portfolio for Molly Von Behren

The page contains two main sections, an about me and pictures and eventually links to my works

## About Me

it contains an about me section where there will be details about my strengths and experiences. I will possibly add a picture of myself on the side but for now its mostly just text

## Works

The works section shows pictures of my works. As I have no works at the moment, I've used placeholder images of cute cats.

most of the pictures are in flexboxes that allow them to align at different viewport sizes but the main picture is outside of the flexboxes and always bigger than the rest. I will put the project I'm most proud of there.

## Footer and Header

The header contains navigation links to my about me, works, and contact me sections of the webpage. It also has a link to the google doc with my resume.

The footer has a link to my GitHub LinkedIn and my phone number
